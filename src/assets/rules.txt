Uno

Players: 2-10

Objective: To be the first player to play all cards
The player to discard all of their cards first wins, the game continues with 
the remaining people competing for second place, and so on. 

Setup: Dealer deals out 7 cards for each player to start with 

Rules: 
On your turn you can play a card only if it meets the following conditions: 
1. It has the same number of the card last played
2. It has the same color of the card last played
3. It is the same special type of the card last played (+2, Skip, or Reverse) 
4. It is a Wild or +4 

If a player has one card left, they must call uno. They will recieve 7 new cards if another
player in the game calls uno before them. 

A player cannot pass their turn if they have a playable card. If they cannot play, 
they will have to draw from the draw pile. 

Special Cards: 
+2 > When played, the player whos turn is next will recieve two cards from the drawpile.
Reverse > When played, the order of the players is reversed. 
Skip > When played, the player who's turn it is next will be skipped, and it will be the player after's turn

Wildcard > When played, a player can change the current color to any of the other three colors (besides the current color)
+4 > This behaves like a wildcard, with the addition of the next player recieving 4 cards from the draw pile.
